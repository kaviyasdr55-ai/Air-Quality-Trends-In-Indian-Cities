🌍 Project Title: Air Quality Trend Analysis in Indian Cities
I’m excited to share my project on Air Quality Trend Analysis across major Indian cities, where I analyzed pollution patterns and AQI variations using real-world environmental data.
📊 Project Overview:
This project focuses on understanding how air quality has changed over time in different Indian cities. By analyzing key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃, I identified trends, seasonal variations, and cities with critical pollution levels.
🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:
* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Data Visualization & Analysis
🔍 Key Insights:
✔ Identified cities with consistently high pollution levels
✔ Observed seasonal air quality variations
✔ Compared AQI trends across multiple cities
✔ Visualized long-term pollution patterns
🎯 Learning Outcomes:
This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and environmental data interpretation, while strengthening my understanding of real-world data-driven problem solving.
🌱 Conclusion:
Air quality analysis plays a crucial role in raising awareness and supporting data-driven decisions for sustainable urban development.
